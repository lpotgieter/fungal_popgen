Nf-core is a very active community around nextflow. Volunteers develop nextflow pipelines around a variety of bioinformatic data. 

Here are some flagship pipelines that have been developed by the nf-core community (we will have a look at the entire list on the nf-core homepage in a bit):

All nf-core pipelines are open source and the source code is available on github. The pipelines are developed by volunteers, who can have a very varied background. 

::: {.callout-note}

While nf-core is fantastic, please be aware that their pipelines are developed and maintained (or not maintained) by the community. **You should not use the pipelines as a black box**, but as a tool you need to understand. The **responsibility for the end results is still yours**, so you need to see if your data is suited for the analysis (good enough quality?), and if the analysis is suitable for your data!

:::

However, nf-core does not only develop pipelines. 

The community also develops: 

- processes that they make available as `modules` (and optimizes them too). 
- training material for all user classes.
- best practices for documentation.
- templates for development.

There is a weekly online helpdesk, and even a podcast. 

### What makes nf-core pipelines interesting for you?

Nf-core provides already developed pipelines for many different data sets. Likely, a pipelines exists that you can use on your data. The **documentation of the pipelines follows nf-core guidelines** and is extensive and informative - it is easy to understand what the pipeline does and how it works. All **output is explained in detail**, with links to more extensive documentation. 

Once you have understood how to run a nf-core pipeline their **consistency and standardization** means you will know most about running a different one. 

Using the nf-core launcher, will **check your input**, and automatically **generate commands and configuration** files.

And this is on top of all nextflow functionality such as portability, reproducibility and the resume-at-fault option!

## Finding and evaluating a pipeline

From the nf-core homepage, we can search for pipelines. We are going to demo the [rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.20.0) pipeline. You can see that there is a lot going on in this pipeline! We will chat more about these things in class rather than including screenshots of everything.

Under the `Usage`, you will find a lot of information that describes the pipeline, including input information, the `samplesheet.csv` (which we will have to set up with our data later).

Under the `Parameters` tab you will find information on all of the things that we will set up in the next step. 

Under the `Output` tab, you will find information on the expected output generated from the pipeline. This is useful to help you interpret what the pipeline produces.

## To do for you
Look through the available pipelines and see if there is one that is interesting for you and your project. 

In the next part we will set up a nf-core pipeline with the test profile, so then you can test the pipeline that is most interesting for you.
