title: "Introduction to Markdown and Quarto"

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for text editing. All of the documents you have seen in this course have been formatted with markdown. The platform this course website has been built on is called Quarto and implements markdown. In this section, we'll look at some of the post commonly used markdown syntax, using Quarto to create lab notebooks, presentations, automate analyses, and host websites like this one.

Recently, a lot of open-source books like [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) and [Python for Data Science](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) have been created with Markdown using Quarto. The code for these books have also been [publicly released](https://quarto.org/docs/books/).

## Markdown Syntax

There are plenty of really great cheatsheets like this one from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) as well as [this one](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). We'll go through some of these details with you live rather than copying and pasting really good tutorials here.

## Using Markdown

There are many different platforms that use Markdown syntax in text editing. At SLUBI, we have a strong preference towards [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or its open-source alternative, [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com). To use all of the features, you need to install the Markdown extension.

To access to Extensions, either navigate with shortcuts (these are operating system depdenent and can be set by users, so we won't go into that, but feel free to explore), from the `View` dropdown menu, or from the `Extensions` tab on the left.

In the search bar, you can search for general Markdown viewers and install them. For this course, we will use Quarto. Install that extension. Please also note the verified tick.

The `Markdown All in One` extension is also an interesting case to look at. It has a lot of downloads despite not being verified by an organisation. In general, be wary when installing extensions. Opt for ones that are installed often, as this one is. If possible, try to use verified extensions. In the age of information security we live in, it is becoming more important to use trusted content than whatever you find on the internet.

## Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is an open-source technical and scientific reporting and publishing system.

### Installing Quarto on your Machine

We have already installed the extension that allows us to use a bunch of really cool features in VSCode with Quarto, but we need to have the backend installed on our machines as well. To install the program, you will click on the `Get Started` link on the homepage, download the program that's suited to your operating system, and install it. The `Guide` link here also takes you to really easy tutorials on how to set up a variety of other uses of Quarto that we simply don't have time for in this course.

All instructions for creating, editing, previewing, and rendering projects will be shown in VSCode and it will not be specified over and over

### Creating a Project

Under the previously shown `View` option, navigate to the `Command Palette`. A dropdown menu at the top will start with a >. Type `quarto` and a list of functions will be shown. The order will be different based on what you've used and what you've used most recently.

![Quarto functions](figures/quarto/quarto_funct.png)

We will `Create a project` and create a `Website` for the purpose of this course.

#### Structure of a Project

All Quarto projects have a YAML file with information about the project called `_quarto.yml` as well as an `index.qmd` file. The landing page of your website is the `index.qmd` file, while the `_quarto.yml` file contains all of the visual aspects of your website. We'll spend a bit of time looking at the design of our course website so that you can see how it looks behind the scenes. Hopefully, with a website you know as well as you do by now, this will make things a lot more tangible!

Fun fact: YAML stands for "yet another markup language"

### Adding Files and Figures

Often, we don't just need a landing page like the `index.qmd` file, but we want different pages, as we have here. You can add blank documents with the .qmd extenstion. It is important for each file to have a title section so that it can be displayed properly and linked with your other pages. Update the `_quarto.yml` file to include this page in your table of contents or navigation bar (depending on what you opted to use), or simply link to the file with a hyperlink as we have done on our landing page

::: {.callout-tip}
Remeber to give your files a good name with no spaces in them. Also remember to add the .qmd extension
:::

To add external figures to your document as we have done here with screenshots, you can simply link to the figure by its relative path, as described [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html).

::: {.callout-tip}
It is good practice to have your images in a folder inside of your Quarto project in case Future You forgets that a figure is linked to a document and you move the folder containing all of your photos, for example. It also makes it much easier to put everything into a repository on GitHub to launch your site
:::

### Adding Analyses

Quarto is really good at implementing other programming languages within it. You can use R within it seamlessly. There is support for a large number of other programming languages within Quarto, but this course is only going to showcase the use of R.

::: {.callout-important}
You will have to install the `R` and `R syntax` extensions for this to work in VSCode
:::

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, palmerpenguins)

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

If you have analyses that you have to repeat across several projects, these documents can be shared to create uniformity among your produced results, and your students do not need to reinvent the wheel. With several pages being supported in a single Quarto project, you also reduce the potential messiness that is introduced whenever you onboard a new student.

### Viewing the Project

#### Previewing

As you go along, you might be interested in seeing what your pages look like. In the terminal, type

`quarto preview`

or simply click the `preview` button in VSCode and a side by side preview will open where you can click through your indexed pages.

#### Different Views

From the Command Palette, you can select whether you would like to view your document in source mode or in visual mode. The difference is mostly that you can interact with the document in the way it will be rendered in visual mode. For some people, visual mode is a lot more intuative, and there is no right or wrong way to interact with your documents.

### Publishing and Sharing the Project

With Quarto, you can render to HTML, Word, and PDF formats. To render individual files into PDF, add the information from [this](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html) Quarto guide into the header of your document.

```{.bash}         
---
title: "My document"
format:
  pdf:
    toc: true
    number-sections: true
    colorlinks: true
---
```

You will have to install a recent distribution of TeX for this via your terminal

```{.bash}         
quarto install tinytex
```

For this course, we are simply going to render our documents into HTML format. In the next section, we will cover how to host Quarto pages on GitHub.
