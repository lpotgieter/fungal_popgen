The first is the absolute path and the second is the relative path. The absolute path gives us information that is true anywhere on your operating system. Whether your terminal is open in /usr/bin/something/ or /var/tmp/, a file will always be located at /usr/Documents/sequence.fasta as it is the true or absolute location. The relative path, as the name suggests, is relative to where you currently are on the file tree. If your terminal is open in /usr/Documents/paper/figures/linux/, the file from before, sequence.fasta will be two folders up from where you are. If you were in /var/bin/something/ it would three folder up, one to the side, and two folders down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is often good practice to use absolute paths when you set pipelines up to run- this way, your programs know where to go looking for the files they’re supposed to work on"

At SLUBI, we have a strong preference towards Visual Studio Code or its open-source alternative, VSCodium. It provides a graphical user interface where you can create, edit, and view files, and see the file system.\nTo be able to connect to a server, you need to install an extension called Remote-SSH from the extensions market place.\n\n\n\nExtensions from View\n\n\n\n\n\nExtensions from the shortcut\n\n\nNow we need to add a host to our list of known hosts. There are several ways of doing this, and all ways lead to establishing a connection.\n\nUnder the previously shown View option, navigate to the Command Palette. A dropdown menu at the top will start with a &gt;. Type Remote-SSH and select add new host. Here we will input our credentials. This will populate a file in a hidden folder, .ssh in your local home directories called known_hosts.\nYou can also write all of these lines manually. This way, you can also specify SSH keys that may be needed to log on to particular servers. We won’t be covering that in this course, though.\n\nAfter a host has been added, you can connect to it. You can do this either through the Command Palette, or through the small blue backwards and forwards arrows in the bottom left corner of VSCode. You will receive a list of known hosts that you can connect to. If you need to connect with a password, a password prompt will be shown.\nOnce connected, you can open the file manager on the left.\nFor privacy concerns, we will share the exact commands locally in the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRemeber to only open either your home directories or the folder for your projects with the file manager. If you try to open folders that are too large, you will cause VSCode to crash (and you may cause significant problems for your system administrator!)"

You can do this through the Command Palette by using the View: Toggle Terminal function, or clicking the box with a dark bottom half and an empty top half in the top right corner of VSCode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Windows Users If you are using a Windows operating system, you can install the free Home edition of MobaXterm when your access to this server is removed if you want to continue practicing your Linux skills.\nTo use MobaXterm as a Linux shell, click on New Session and select a bash shell. There will probably be a prompt that you have to installl an extension. Click on the link it will provide, or copy the extension it needs and search it on Google (or your preferred search engine) and install it. Then try starting a new session again.\n\n\n\nTo see where we currently are in the filesystem, we use the present working directory command. This will give us the absolute path of the directory that our terminal open in.\npwd\nTo see the files that are currently in the directory we use the list command.\nls\nTo make a directory, we use the make directory command, followed by the name we would like our directory to have. Here we will make a directory called sida_training.\nmkdir sida_training\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we give files and folders names, we don’t use spaces or special characters. It makes it really difficult to access files. We can use different ways to name our files and folders 1. youcanbechaoticandusenothing 2. YouCanUseCapitalLetters 3. you_can_use_underscores 4. you-can-use-dashes The most important thing is to be consistent with what you use, and to use descriptive names that are not too long. Future you will thank past you!\n\n\n\nTo enter the sida_training directory, we will use the change directory command.\ncd sida_training\nWe can use the pwd command again just to make sure that we are indeed in the right folder.\nTo go back to the folder we were in previously, we can use a shortcut rather than the absolute path.\ncd ..\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no limits to the amount of directories you can go back (provided they are in your filesystem). If you wanted to go up 3 directories, you’d use\ncd ../../..\n\n\n\nTo delete files and folder you use the remove command. If you want to remove a folder, you need a recursive flag.\nrm -r sida_training\nIf we had a file to look at, we could use the less command. In the interface, we press q to quit.\nless filename\nWith these Linux basics, you will certainly be able to follow our course. If you would like to learn more, Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry have excellent tutorials on using the terminal in more detail, and we can only recommend them!"

    "title": "Containers",
    "section": "Containers",
    "text": "Containers\n\nWhat are containers?\nContainers are stand-alone pieces of software that require a container management tool to run. They are build and exchanged as container images that specify the contents of the container, such as the operating system, all dependencies, and software in an isolated environment. The container management tool then takes the images and build the container. These management tools can be run on all operating systems, and since the container has the operating system within it, it will run the same in all environments. Container images are easily portable and immutable, so they are stable over time.\n\n\nRunning Containers\nThere are several programs that can be used to build and run containers. Docker, Appptainer, and Podman are the most commonly used platforms to date. They all have their pros and cons. If you are using a Windows machine that only you are using, then Docker is likely the least complex tool to install. On multi-user systems like a server, Apptainer is the best tool for the job. For this tutorial and the rest of the course, we will use Apptainer commands. There are small syntax changes between bash and powershell commands, but they are very similar.\n\n\nDownloading Container Images\nThere are several repositories for people to publish container images that they have specified. Dockerhub and Seqera are two commonly used platforms for downloading container images. You are able to use container images from dockerhub on Apptainer without any problems.\n\ndockerhub Tutorial\nOn the dockerhub landing page, you have a search bar, and some login options. You do not need to create an account to access the containers on dockerhub.\n\n\n\ndockerhub landing page\n\n\nFor these tutorials, we’ll search VCFtools, a commonly used software for VCF manipulation and querying. The results of the search give us several different containers with the same name.\n\n\n\nRegistry search\n\n\nYou can see who made the container image, how many times it has been downloaded (or pulled), when it was updated (here updated means different versions of the image being uploaded), and how many people have starred it. It is usually a good rule of thumb to use the most popular images from users that have uploaded a lot of container images. The biocontainers and pegi3s profiles have builds for a lot of tools, and they are built really well!\nIf we click on the vcftools from biocontainers we get to a typical dockerhub image landing page:\n\n\n\nVCFtools page\n\n\nThere is information on the frequency of the container image being pulled, as well as a pull command to download the image. This command is for docker, so we need to modify it for Apptainer.\napptainer pull vcftools_0.1.16-1.sif docker://biocontainers/vcftools:v0.1.16-1-deb_cv1\nThis command has several parts to it:\n\napptainer calls on the Apptainer software to run\npull tells Apptainer which function to use. In this case, we want it to go fetch something from a repository\nvcftools_0.1.16-1.sif is the name of the container image on our local machine. We could call it I_Love_Dogs but that is not very informative at all. Your collaborator won’t know what it means, and you certainly won’t know what it means in 6 months from now! It is also good practice to put the version number in your image name in case you want to have several versions at the same time, and you need to tell them apart.\ndocker:// is the registry you are pulling from. There are several different registries, but we are only going to show 2 during this course. (You will see another one in the Seqera tutorial)\nbiocontainers/vcftools is the profile/repository and container you are pulling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nFile format extensions like .txt and .sif are really only important for us. However, it is good practice to append your files with appropriate extensions to ensure that you follow good data management practices\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in a different version than the current version, there are other versions under the tags tab:\n\n\n\nContainer versions\n\n\nIf you wanted to download another version of the container, you simply copy the command shown on the right side, and alter the syntax, for example\napptainer pull vcftools0.1.14.sif docker://biocontainers/vcftools:v0.1.14_cv2\n\n\nSeqera Tutorial\nThe Seqera landing page is a bit different from the dockerhub landing page, and it works a bit differently from dockerhub. Dockerhub hosts container images that users have uploaded, while Seqera makes container images as you request them. They use bioconda, conda-forge, and pypi libraries to build their containers images with Wave. The advantage is that you can include several different softwares in your container image at once. The disadvantage is that you are limited to software hosted on the aforementioned repositories. Usually this isn’t a problem, but sometimes you want to use something that isn’t hosted there.\n\n\n\nSeqera containers landing page\n\n\nWhen you pull an image from Seqera and want to run it with Apptainer, you need to remember to change the container setting from Docker to Singularity, the older name of Apptainer.\n\n\n\nSelecting Singularity\n\n\nSince Seqera builds containers on-demand, sometimes you have to wait for the container to finish compiling. You can see that it is still preparing the container image from the fetching container comment. Don’t try to pull it when it is still building!\n\n\n\nWaiting to build\n\n\nWhen the container image is ready, you can copy the text and pull the image to your system:\n\n\n\nReady to download\n\n\napptainer pull vcftools_0.1.17.sif oras://community.wave.seqera.io/library/vcftools:0.1.17--b541aa8d9f9213f9\nHere we use oras:// instead of docker:// as we are pulling from the oras registry. We are also pulling a different version from Seqera, so the name of the container is different.\n\n\n\nRunning Containers\nOnce you have the container image on your local machine, you want to be able to use it. Apptainer can be used to build the container from the image. Then you can either enter the container and run as if you had the exact same operating system as the person who built it, or you can run the software inside the container from outside of the container.\nThere are 2 different ways to use a container: run and exec. The apptainer run command launches the container and first runs the %runscript for the container if one is defined, and then runs your command (we will cover %runscript in the Building Containers section). The apptainer exec command will not run the %runscript even if one is defined. It is a small, fiddly detail that might be applicable if you use other people’s containers. After calling Apptainer and the run or exec commands, you can use your software as you usually would\napptainer exec vcftools_0.1.17.sif vcftools --version\nThis command runs your vcftools_0.1.17.sif container from the image, calls on the program vcftools that is within the container, and shows you the version. If you had installed VCFtools locally, you would have just used\nvcftools --version\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPlease remember that VCFtools is just an example. If you want to run any other tool everything after apptainer run or apptainer exec has to be substituted by the name of the specific container image and the run commands for that particular tool!\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Containers\nIf the software you would like to use is not packaged into a container by anyone else, you might want to build it yourself. For this, we are just going to show a very simple example. Building containers from scratch is a computationally intensive task. You build containers from a definition file with the extension .def\nHere we are going to build a container with a cow telling us the date. Save this in a file called lolcow.def.\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: ubuntu:20.04\n\n%post\n    apt-get -y update\n    apt-get -y install cowsay lolcat fortune\n\n%environment\n    export LC_ALL=C\n    export PATH=/usr/games:$PATH\n\n%runscript\n    date | cowsay | lolcat    \nThere are several components to this definition file.\n\nYou can set the operating system you want in the container, in this case Ubuntu 20.04.\n%post section is where you update the OS from its base state, install dependencies and so on.\n%environment is where you export paths and modify the environment.\n%runscript is the script that will run when you use apptainer run container.sif. If you don’t include a runscript, then nothing will happen when you try to run it without any commands. You could build this container without anything in the %runscript section, and use apptainer run container.sif date | cowsay | lolcat to get the same output.\n\napptainer build lolcow.sif lolcow.def\nYou’ll get a lot of output on the status of the build, ending in\nINFO:    Adding environment to container\nINFO:    Adding runscript\nINFO:    Creating SIF file...\nINFO:    Build complete: lolcow.sif\nWe can now run our new container with\napptainer run lolcow.sif\n\n\n\nBoring cow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTry removing the %runscript, build it again, and see what happens.\n\n\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: ubuntu:20.04\n\n%post\n    apt-get -y update\n    apt-get -y install cowsay lolcat fortune\n\n%environment\n    export LC_ALL=C\n    export PATH=/usr/games:$PATH\n\n%runscript\n    fortune | cowsay | lolcat    \nIf we use the same definition file as before, but substitute date for fortune in the runscript and build the container, we now get a philosophical cow with a dark sense of humour:\n\n\n\nFun cow\n\n\n\n\n\nInspirational cow\n\n\nTo show the difference between the run and exec commands, we can use the same container with fortune in the runscript and run:\napptainer run lolcow.sif bash -c \"date|cowsay\"\nand\napptainer exec lolcow.sif bash -c \"date|cowsay\"\nThe run command gives us a philosophical cow while exec gives us our boring cow again."

The Guide link here also takes you to really easy tutorials on how to set up a variety of other uses of Quarto that we simply don’t have time for in this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll instructions for creating, editing, previewing, and rendering projects will be shown in VSCode and it will not be specified over and over\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Project\nUnder the previously shown View option, navigate to the Command Palette. A dropdown menu at the top will start with a &gt;. Type quarto and a list of functions will be shown. The order will be different based on what you’ve used and what you’ve used most recently.\n\n\n\nQuarto functions\n\n\nWe will Create a project and create a Website for the purpose of this course.\n\n\n\nCreating a Project\n\n\n\nStructure of a Project\nAll Quarto projects have a YAML file with information about the project called _quarto.yml as well as an index.qmd file. The landing page of your website is the index.qmd file, while the _quarto.yml file contains all of the visual aspects of your website. We’ll spend a bit of time looking at the design of our course website so that you can see how it looks behind the scenes. Hopefully, with a website you know as well as you do by now, this will make things a lot more tangible!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nFun fact: YAML stands for “yet another markup language”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Files and Figures\nOften, we don’t just need a landing page like the index.qmd file, but we want different pages, as we have here. You can add blank documents with the .qmd extenstion. It is important for each file to have a title section so that it can be displayed properly and linked with your other pages. Update the _quarto.yml file to include this page in your table of contents or navigation bar (depending on what you opted to use), or simply link to the file with a hyperlink as we have done on our landing page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemeber to give your files a good name with no spaces in them. Also remember to add the .qmd extension\n\n\nTo add external figures to your document as we have done here with screenshots, you can simply link to the figure by its relative path, as described here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is good practice to have your images in a folder inside of your Quarto project in case Future You forgets that a figure is linked to a document and you move the folder containing all of your photos, for example. It also makes it much easier to put everything into a repository on GitHub to launch your site\n\n\n\n\nAdding Analyses\nQuarto is really good at implementing other programming languages within it. You can use R within it seamlessly. There is support for a large number of other programming languages within Quarto, but this course is only going to showcase the use of R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou will have to install the R and R syntax extensions for this to work in VSCode\n\n\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)\n) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have analyses that you have to repeat across several projects, these documents can be shared to create uniformity among your produced results, and your students do not need to reinvent the wheel. With several pages being supported in a single Quarto project, you also reduce the potential messiness that is introduced whenever you onboard a new student.\n\n\nViewing the Project\n\nPreviewing\nAs you go along, you might be interested in seeing what your pages look like. In the terminal, type\nquarto preview\nor simply click the preview button in VSCode and a side by side preview will open where you can click through your indexed pages.\n\n\n\nVSCode Preview function\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Views\nFrom the Command Palette, you can select whether you would like to view your document in source mode or in visual mode. The difference is mostly that you can interact with the document in the way it will be rendered in visual mode. For some people, visual mode is a lot more intuative, and there is no right or wrong way to interact with your documents.\n\n\n\nPublishing and Sharing the Project\nWith Quarto, you can render to HTML, Word, and PDF formats. To render individual files into PDF, add the information from this Quarto guide into the header of your document.\n---\ntitle: \"My document\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    toc: true\n    number-sections: true\n    colorlinks: true\n---\nYou will have to install a recent distribution of TeX for this via your terminal\nquarto install tinytex\nFor this course, we are simply going to render our documents into HTML format. In the next section, we will cover how to host Quarto pages on GitHub."

Wratten et al. (2021) Nature Methods\n\nWith workflow managers you can develop an automated pipeline from your scripts that can then be run on a variety of systems. Once it is developed, execute a single command to start the pipeline. The manager then coordinates the deployment of the scripts in the appropriate sequence, monitors the jobs, handles the file transfers between scripts, gathers the output, and handles re-execution of failed jobs for you. Workflow managed pipelines can run containers, which eliminates software installation and version conflicts.\nThat means that by design the pipelines are:\n\nportable\nmore time efficient (no more downtime between pipeline steps)\nmore resource efficient (mostly, but this might vary depending how skilled a developer you yourself are)\neasier to install (especially when combined with containers, or environment managers)\nmore reproducible\n\nThere are in principle two different flavors of workflow managers: snakemake, and nextflow. In this course we will be introducing you to nexflow."

However, if you are interested, there are a lot of very good training materials available online.\n\n\nThe executable part of the processes, the so called script, can be written in any language, so in theory you could always choose the language that is best suited for the job (in practice you might be limited to the languages you know). However, the modularity of the processes allows for easy re-use of existing scripts and processes.\nWhen moving the pipeline from one system to another, the script stays the same and does not change, the same containers are used. The only thing that changes are the parameters that pertain to the environment and available resources. In other words, with nextflow, the functional logic, the processes, are separated from the executive (how the workflow runs). This makes the nextflow pipelines highly interoperable and portable. They can be run on various platforms, such as HPC clusters, local computers, cloud systems etc..\nThe pipelines can be integrated with version control tools, such as git or bitbucket, and containers technologies, such as apptainer or docker. This makes the pipeline very reproducible.\nThe nextflow pipelines are extremely scalable, can be developed on a few samples and easily be run on hundreds or thousands of samples. When possible, processes are run in parallel automatically.\nNexflow performs automatic checks on the processes and their in- and output. It can automatically resume execution at a point of failure without having to re-compute successfully completed parts.\nNextflow is open source.\nHere is a more visual summary of some of the points above:\n\n\n\nsource: Maxime U Garcia, Seqera labs"

To create an environment, you have to specify a name for your environment. You can include different platforms/operating systems in your environment, for example if you want to develop your code on a Windows system, and later use the same code on many samples on a large Linux cluster. You can also include different vetted sources for your tools, the so called channels.\nHere, we will create a project called name_sida_training (please use your own name to avoid creating multiple environments with the same name). We are adding the conda-forge and bioconda channels with the -c flag.\npixi init name_sida_training -c conda-forge -c bioconda\nPixi will create a folder named name_sida_training with a a file pixi.toml.

Before ML, algorithms had to be programmed by hand rather than having the algorithms learn features of a dataset. With ML, features of a dataset can be annotated based on previously annotated datasets. These algorithms were a mix of supervised (learning on annotated data) and unsupervised (learning on unannotated data) learning, depending on the function of the algorithm.\nSupervised algorithms are used for classification and regression analyses. Unsupervised algorithms are used to discover hidden patterns in data without needing a human’s input.

Generative AI (GenAI) models now come in many different flavours, depending on the developer.\n\n\n\nGenAI chatbots by market share in August 2025 from FirstPageSage\n\n\nAs with earlier iterations of supervised and unsupervised algorithms, these self-supervised algorithms also need data to be trained.\n\nTraining Data\nGenAI has all been trained on existing data. There has always been a bias in whose information gets captured. In a historical context, history was recorded by the party that won the war and destroyed existing knowledge. This also changed as different empires and narratives rose and fell. With digitisation, this information has landed on the internet. In the more modern “Internet Age”, everyone with an internet connection can technically post anything they’d like on the internet. There are different biases at play- not everyone has equal access to the internet, some people may not have strong enough opinions to post about something online, some people prefer to read rather than contribute, while others take pleasure in “shit-posting”.\nThe differences in how people use the internet have an effect on how useful the trained models become. In this example, you can clearly see what the effect of bad training data is.\n\n\n\nGenAI answer to a simple question\n\n\nGenAI’s are not programmed to say that they do not know something, and will happily hallucinate an answer. If you do not know better, or trust the computers, you may take this answer as true and post it elsewhere. As the use of AI’s increases, AI generated content is used to train new AI’s. Gary Illyes from Google has spoken about “human curated” vs “human created” data being used as training data.\nIn a perfect world, GenAI would be trained on perfectly curated data, but even with all of the data that we have on the internet at the moment, we do not have nearly enough data for this. We have to make do with what we have."

    "section": "Some Words of Caution",
    "text": "Some Words of Caution\nGenAI is becoming more integrated in every sector of our lives. It is important that we use the new technology responsibly. When Google first came out, there were classes on how to use the search engine, determine validity of sources and information, and how to stay safe on the internet. This section aims to raise awareness about commonly overlooked aspects of GPT use.\n\nLearning with AI\nAI has great potential in the field of education. ChatGPT has been shown to be highly beneficial in an educational environment when integrated properly. However, the use of AI in this setting must be balanced and carefully curated. A 2025 pre-print by Kosmyna et al showed that adults that used ChatGPT to write SAT type essays were outperformed consistently by adults that wrote the same essay without the support of an AI, and had significantly lower brain engagement.\n\n\nProductivity with AI\nA recent study by a non-profit group, Model Evaluation and Threat Research [(METR)https://metr.org/] aimed to quantify the difference in productivity when using AI. Participants in this study were not new to their field, with at least 5 years of experience prior to this study being conducted.\n\n\n\nAI reducing productivity\n\n\nThe study also found that when AI is allowed, the participants spent less time coding and seeking solutions to the problems. Rather, they spent time prompting the AI, reading and reviewing responses, and being idle. Intel produced similar findings.\n\n\n\nReasons for loss of productivity with AI\n\n\nIf one combines the effect of passively learning with AI and the loss of productivity with, it becomes clear that AI must be used very carefully.\n\n\nData Privacy and Legal Concerns\nData privacy has been vital in the development and use of AI. The use of copyrighted material in training AI is being discussed and debated in several courts. The questions around using text and data mining are divisive with some parties arguing that finding patterns, trends, and insights in existing data being how new research is done by humans and should be extended to AI, while others, particularly in the European context, disagree to some extent. Understanding the legality of the service you use in different countries falls on you as a user.\nThe Terms of Service (ToS) of different GPTs are important when deciding whether to use a GPT at all. For example, Deepseek’s ToS (collected on 15.08.2025) states\nAccount Personal Data. We collect Personal Data that you provide when you set up an account, such as your date of birth (where applicable), username (where applicable), email address and/or telephone number, and password.\nUser Input. When you use our Services, we may collect your text input, prompt, uploaded files, feedback, chat history, or other content that you provide to our model and Services (“Prompts” or \"Inputs\"). We generate responses (“Outputs”) based on your Inputs.\nPersonal Data When You Contact Us. When you contact us, we collect the Personal Data you send us, such as proof of identity or age, contact details, feedback or inquiries about your use of the Services or Personal Data about possible violations of our Terms of Service (our “Terms”) or other policies.\nBiological data enjoys a high level of protection, and is often considered as highly sensitive. Too often, users will input sequences, tables, or other data into a GPT to find ways to plot data, perform sequence annotations, or similar tasks. Be wary of doing this. Check the ToS explicitly, and frequently. Try to use GDPR compliant GPT’s if you must use a GPT.\nAI as browser extensions steal deeply personal information when enabled in a users’ browser including financial, education, and medical information, whether an extension is being actively used or not. The authors have also commented on how these practices interfere with the company’s own ToS as well as privacy legislation.\n\n\nPersonal Responsibility\nYou as a user are responsible for the AI generated content you choose to use. If you, for instance, ask AI to generate a brand logo for you that is too close to something that exists already, the original owner is free to sue you as an individual for copyright infringement.\nAs scientists, we know that we should use peer-reviewed resources whenever possible. It is why we cannot cite Wikipedia in a scientific article. GPT’s have been widely shown to fabricate citations based on how it has learnt a citation should look. It is up to you as a user to check every single citation that AI generates since you are responsible for what you write.\n\n\nGlobal Linguistic Changes\nEven though ChatGPT has only been widely used for 3 years, it has already started leaving its traces in how we speak. Words like delve and meticulous are being used more frequently in academic YouTube talks.\n\n\n\nGPT words in YouTube videos from Yakura et al 2025\n\n\nIt has also been shown that different GPT’s have different writing styles, also known as idiolects.\nSome projects like this one are trying to match GPT ideolects match that of unique users. This will make detecting AI use more difficult in future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course was written by two people, and each person wrote their own sections without the use of any AI. Can you tell who wrote which sections based on idiolects?\n\n\n\nWe know that subtle linguistic shifts can change emotional regulation within an individual. We also know that sociolinguistics, even the slightest linguistic features, serve to bind or divide us.\n\n\nAI on the Internet\nSocial media platforms are an important aspect in the development, improvement, and implementation of GenAI models. OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT, have used a subreddit on the social media platform, Reddit, to train their new algorithm. Google and OpenAI have contractual agreements with Reddit to license data from the users on the platform. Earlier in 2025, researchers from the University of Zurich were implicated in an experiment on the same subreddit OpenAI used to train a model. They wanted to test whether an interaction with a bot was more likely to make people change their minds than an interaction with a real person. This was heavily frowned upon, and posts were all removed as users had no ability to consent to participating in a study. It has also been suggested that interactions observed by the researchers were just bots arguing with each other.\nA preprint released in February 2025 by Liang et al found that the amount of content generated by AI rose from 2-3% in November 2022 to 24% by the end of 2023.\n\n\n\nAI slop trough by Yahoo! News!\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmnetal Impact\nThe facilities to run GenAI require a significant amount of resources. These facilities need a huge amount of electricity to power the facility (this places extreme strain on exising infrastructure and increases the grid’s carbon footprint) as well as water to cool the hardware. Currently, data centers use more electricity than many independent countries.\nSome data centers are being built near poor communities, drain resources from, and add pollution to the community (see Colossus that has been built in Memphis to power the X bot, Grok for an example. Musk is not the only offender.)\nWhile we cannot do anything about where data centers are built, we can make informed decisions about which platforms (if any), we use. We can also be careful with the number of queries we send, and how we use our queries. In April 2025, the CEO of OpenAI said that polite requests like “please” and “thank you” have cost tens of millions of dollars due to the cost of electricity."

    "text": "How To Decide When To Use AI\nIf we know the risks and the true cost of what we are doing, we can make informed decisions about how we chose to incorporate new technologies into our day-to-day and working lives.\nHere are some questions that we find useful to ask ourselves before opening a GPT:\n\nAm I phrasing my prompt in a good way? Here is a guide to prompt engineering that might be useful\nCan I find this information any other way?\nHow much time am I saving by looking this question up here vs on BioStars, for example?\nDo I know enough about the topic to know whether the GPT is lying to me?\nWhat are the consequences of testing the validity of the GPT solution? Can I potentially corrupt my data or my system? Is there a potential for me to lie to someone who trusts me enough to ask my opinion?\n\nIf a GPT is used to learn a new skill, remember how important active learning is. Seek explanations for everything the GPT tells you. Find independent sources that were produced by experts to validate your learning.\nHold on to the ability to learn and the desire to be curious."
